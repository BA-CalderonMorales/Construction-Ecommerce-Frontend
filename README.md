# Construction-Ecommerce-Frontend

<h1>Status</h1>
<p>Currently, the web app is working off of the tutorial series "Full Stack MERN Project - Build and Deploy an App | React + Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB" My 
  goal is to use the tools that I learn from this tutorial series, along with what I've learned from my time at DevCodeCamp, to create a powerful, scalable 
  web app for construction ecommerce businesses.
</p>
<br>
<p>The reason I decided to use the YouTube video to help me start this project is because the creator is an active member of the GitHub community. He believes 
  in open source development, and I really appreciate that mindset. As an aspiring software developer, I've always found myself thinking that I'm going to
  create something that no one has ever seen before. More than 90% of the time, it's been built already (several times). So, that's where I'm at.
</p>
<br>
<p>Once I finish with the project, I'll be deploying the versions of it via Netlify, and hopefully I can make something that's worth a second look! Here is the
  YouTube series if you want to try it out for yourself. Shouts out to my man Adrian (JavaScript Mastery) for posting it: <br>
